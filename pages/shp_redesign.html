        <h1>Redesigning Columbia SHP's Website</h1>
        <p>Each year, Columbia University opens its Science Honors Program to hundreds of high school students
        across the tri-state area. The free program provides an exploratory experience for high schoolers with
        an interest in math or science through weekend lectures led by graduate students and professors.
        Students participate in a rigorous application process (including two tests) to attend, and the
        competition grows fiercer every year.</p>
        <p>
        As a former participant myself, Columbia University’s Science Honors Program (SHP for short) was an
        incredible and unique experience. The only problem? <a target="_blank" href="http://columbia.edu/cu/shp/index.html">The program’s website</a> poses a unique challenge to its users:</p>

        <img src="../assets/SHP_landing_page.png" />

        <h2>Problems with an Antiquated Design</h2>
        <p>The most notable user issue with the SHP website is its style and layout-- users who are used to
        modern sites with large text, ample spacing, and sleek menus could be at first confused by the
        “vintage” layout of this homepage. Although all links are clearly marked and labeled, the user expects to
        see a page adhering to certain modern standards, and the lack of these causes the design to feel
        unintuitive and inefficient.</p>

        <p>At immediate glance, lack of a distinct visual hierarchy of color or size makes the information of this page difficult to scan. Although some information is
        bolded, the lack of other distinctions combined with the monotonous blocks of inline
        text create a cluttered layout.</p>
        <p>In this project, we aim to redesign the layout of this website, and address some of these problems.</p>

        <h2>Wireframing</h2>
        <p>To begin, I reimagined each of the major pages of the SHP website with low-fidelity wireframes:</p>

        <div class="image-set">
            <div>
                <img src="../assets/redesign_project/wireframe_photos/CS1300 Redesign Wireframe-1.png" />
                <div class="caption">Homepage</div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <img src="../assets/redesign_project/wireframe_photos/CS1300 Redesign Wireframe-2.png" />
                <div class="caption">Course Selection</div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <img src="../assets/redesign_project/wireframe_photos/CS1300 Redesign Wireframe-3.png" />
                <div class="caption">Application Page</div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <img src="../assets/redesign_project/wireframe_photos/CS1300 Redesign Wireframe-4.png" />
                <div class="caption">About the Program</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>My main goals with these initial designs was to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Present a simple, elegant layout that modern users are more comfortable with</li>
            <li>Create a strong visual hierarchy</li>
            <li>Increase ease and intuitiveness of navigation</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>High-Fidelity Mockup</h2>
        <p>Next, I created a colored mock-up of the redesigned homepage:</p>

        <img src="../assets/redesign_project/CS1300 Redesign Mockup.png" />

        <p>In this mockup, I 
        created visual differences between different parts of the page-- for example, the title is given a unique
        font, menu items have distinct text size and take on button-like shapes, and the title for “Current
        Announcements” is given a much larger text size than the announcements themselves. I used a grid
        for the announcements section to make it easy for readers to see the distinct announcements, and
        placed the site’s introductory blurb in a uniquely-colored and -positioned box to make it easily ignorable
        for frequent site users who are just checking for new announcements</p>
        <p>I chose a modern-looking, simple palette that imitates the palette of Columbia
        University’s main homepage, solidifying the connection between the program and the university and
        reinforcing the site's reliability in the user’s eyes. I used an accent color to highlight the
        “How to Apply” button so that new users can quickly find the most important information regarding the
        program, and ensured that colors varied across the page for a visually interesting layout that does not
        impede readability.</p>

        <h2>Responsive Development</h2>
        <p>Finally, I created a <a target="_blank" href="../assets/redesign_project/handin/shp_main.html">live, responsive web page version</a> of this mockup, which resizes and adjusts dynamically to the size of the viewport. </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>I designed a new, modern interface for the Columbia SHP Program's website. While simpler, more bare-bones interfaces do not inherently impede user access and ease of use, modern websites can make use of modern users' expectations and intuitions to create a more elegant website experience.</p>

        <p>This project was undertaken as a personal project, and is not affilated or endorsed by Columbia University or the Science Honors Program.</p>
